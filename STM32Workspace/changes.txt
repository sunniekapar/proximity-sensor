Changes:
- Fixed file architecture for entire project, added entire STM32 codespace into one folder along with the design document and all other relevant project materials
- Created a new branch for changes to be reviewed before being merged with the main branch

Changes:
- Implented the ultrasonic sensor in the STM32CUBEIDE and got it working with the MCU. This core feature is the basis of the rest of the project
  and will be changed with the rest of the other features
- Got LED to light up when object was detected, and turn off when the object was taken out of the way

Changes:
- Implemented the passive buzzer in the STM32CUBEIDE and got it working with the MCU. This component is the key component to the project and will be 
paired with the ultrasonic sensor to alert users.
- Got the passive buzzer to change rate.

- Implemented the main feature of the design: got the HCSR04 Sensor to work with the buzzer
- The buzzer now alters the rate at which it makes a noise depending on the distance of the object to the design
